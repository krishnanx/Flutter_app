# Junior Flutter Developer Task | Lascade

This project is a "mobile e-commerce application" built using Flutter, showcasing integration with the Fake Store API to display product listings, details, and cart functionalities.

The app retrieves product data dynamically from the API and presents it in a clean, responsive UI. State management is handled using Riverpod, enabling a scalable and reactive architecture with clear separation of logic and UI.

Future Implementation: User authentication, order history tracking, payment gateway integration, and persistent local cart using shared preferences or Hive.
